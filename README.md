# Porfolio Site for Ashley Fejeran

This is a simple, static portfolio site for Ashley Fejeran.

It's built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and hosted (for free!) at [Divshot](https://divshot.com/).

## Fire It Up

To get site running locally, first clone the repo...

```git clone https://github.com/nrbernard/ashley-portfolio.git```

... navigate to the new directory...

```cd ashley-portfolio```

... and install Jekyll:

```gem install jekyll```

Then, run `jekyll serve` and navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see the site in action.

After making changes, run `jekyll build` to have Jekyll generate an updated static site in `_.site`. You can also add the `--watch` flag to that command to have Jekyll watch for changes. Here are some more [handy commands](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).
